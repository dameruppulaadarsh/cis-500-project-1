# CIS 500 Project 1

The goals of the project are to 
* Practice writing Python code using conditionals, loops, and the mod operator
* Practice writing unit tests for functions.

## Prerequisites

<b>Before you begin:</b> Make sure you have 
 * created a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account,
 * installed `git` on the machine(s) you plan to use. ([Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) is a popular choice.)
 * created a public/private ssh keypair, and
 * uploaded the public key to your GitHub account. (See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw1k0PUpSeM).)

## Instructions

For this project, you will write and test a Python module that contains several date-related functions.

1. Begin by following this GitHub Classroom link (https://classroom.github.com/a/S3bMe4pm), accepting the assignment, then cloning the resulting repo.

2. Next, look at `my_date.py`.  This file contains shells for the four functions you will implement. A comment in each function describes its expected behavior. Ask the instructor if it is not clear what a function should do.

3. Now look at `my_date_student_test.py`. This file contains an example unit test for each function.
 Using these examples, write a complete set of "black box" unit tests for each function. When your unit tests are complete <b>Commit and push your repo with a commit message that contains "<em>[Grade Tests]</em>"</b>. (This commit message will tell me that you are ready for me to examine your tests.)

4. <em>One you have written your tests</em>, implement the four functions. Use your tests to verify that your code is correct.

5. Once your code passes your tests, commit and push your code, then run the instructor's automated tests.

6. If any of the instructor's tests fail, that means your set of tests is incomplete. 
   1. Write a failing test (i.e., figure out what test case you are missing), 
   2. fix your code so the new test case passes, 
   3. Add a reflection to `reflection.txt`. This reflection should describe
      * The test case you overlooked, 
      * Thoughts about how it got overlooked,
      * Steps you will take in the future to avoid a similar mistake.
   4. Repeat step 5 above until your code passes all the instructor tests.

When your code passes all the instructor tests, and you have completed the reflection document, push a commit with the commit message that contains "<em>[Grade Me]</em>".

<b>Important:</b> Your reflection document should contain at least one entry for each time you ran the instructor tests.
